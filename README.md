Lucky Birthday

A Web App to determine if your birthday is lucky. The app takes a birthdate and
the user's lucky number as an input. It divides the sum of digits of the birthdate
by the lucky no. If they are perfectly divisible, it let's the user know that the
birthdate is lucky. If not, it let's the user know that it is not lucky.
